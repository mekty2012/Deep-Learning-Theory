This repository contains theoretical papers related to the neural network and deep learning, with short summary of their abstract. 
I usually collect papers from arxivist, and (try to) update the list weekly.
I cannot guarantee that my summary is correct, and the result of paper is correct. Also, the contents of paper may change after I add to this repository, so please check the paper itself.

For the explanation of topics, see [Topics](topics.md). For some keywords appearing in the summary, see [Keywords](keywords.md).
