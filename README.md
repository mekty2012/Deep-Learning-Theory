## Genetic Programming for MAP

There is a SA based MA inference algorithm in Anglican. If so, why not genetic algorithm?

## Towards a liquid type for probabilistic programming

We have various liquid type in traditional programming langauge. Main fallacy in probabilistic programming is that testing is really hard. How can we?

## Software Testing on probabilistic programming

Software testing works very well for problems as liveness and safety. However, hyperproperties are not that simple, like probability or security.
Can we extend software testing, like importance software testing, so that we can safely test probability-related hyperproperties?

### Computability in Probabilistic Programming Language

From the definition of Anglican, it is obvious that ProbProg has either density function or mass function. Can we extend this scope? If not, what random variables can be computed?
