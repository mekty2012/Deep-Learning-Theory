## PyTracer: Automatically profiling numerical instabilities in Python

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11508>

Design a profiler to quantify numerical instability, by visualizing the numerical traces interactively, which is agnostic to numerical noise models.

### Efficient Automatic Differentiation of Implicit Functions

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14217>

Show that application of implicit function theorem or specialized adjoint methods can be generalized to any implicit function, where generalized adjoint method is more effective.
